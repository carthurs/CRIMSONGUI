# Contributing to CRIMSONGUI
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Ensure that you've tested your changes. Create tests if possible. Describe the tests in your commit messages / pull request.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the repository's license
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [license](LICENSE.txt) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/carthurs/CRIMSONFlowsolver/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/carthurs/CRIMSONGUI/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of good quality bug report. Here's [another example](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [This Stackoverflow question example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
If you're editing a file, try to match the coding style that it uses. Generally, prefer long, descriptive variable names, self-documenting code, and comments where the self-documentation is insufficient.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same [license](LICENSE.txt) that covers the project.
